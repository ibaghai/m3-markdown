Directions: 

Fork and Clone this repo

Edit the ReadMe to include a Linux command that weâ€™ve learned so far (i.e. list files in a directory, make a new directory, etc)

Your ReadMe should include the following Markdown features:

* Code highlighting (for the Linux command)
* SubList within a List
* Header

After that is complete commit and push your changes
